# Cloudflare-First Next.js Starter Kit

Launch a production-grade Next.js application that runs natively on Cloudflare Workers from the very first commit. This starter stitches together the platform bindings, developer ergonomics, and CI/CD automation you need to ship edge-ready features without reinventing the scaffolding.

## Technology Pillars

Everything you need for a modern full-stack experience comes prewired:

- **Next.js App Router** with React Server Components, streaming responses, and edge-aware rendering defaults.
- **TypeScript everywhere** with strict configuration, ESLint, Vitest, and Playwright-ready integration tests.
- **Tailwind-friendly styling** via PostCSS and CSS Modules when you need handcrafted components.
- **OpenNext build pipeline** tuned for Wrangler so Workers deployments and previews mirror production.
- **Cloudflare bindings** for D1, R2, and KV declared in `wrangler.jsonc` with matching types in `cloudflare-env.d.ts`.
- **Drizzle ORM** plus schema-first migrations to keep SQL changes predictable and traceable.
- **Better Auth with React Email** wiring for password sign-in, session storage on D1, and transactional templates rendered with Resend-ready components.
- **Storybook workspace** for component-driven development and visual QA.
- **Automated code hygiene** enforced with Prettier, ESLint, lint-staged, and Lefthook-managed Git hooks plus Commitizen prompts.

## Launch in Minutes

Follow this path to fork the project, wire it into your Cloudflare account, and provision the backing services.

1. **Fork the repository** ‚Äì Create a GitHub fork so Cloudflare can track your branch builds.
2. **Import the fork in Cloudflare Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to **Workers & Pages ‚Üí Create application ‚Üí Worker** (or open the account-agnostic shortcut at <https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers-and-pages/create>).
   - Choose **Connect to Git**, authorize GitHub, and pick your fork.
   - Let the initial build finish so Cloudflare mirrors your `main` branch.
3. **Provision Cloudflare data services** ‚Äì Create the bindings and paste the identifiers into `wrangler.jsonc`.

   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 create cf-next-starter-d1
   npx wrangler r2 bucket create cf-next-starter-r2
   npx wrangler kv namespace create cf-next-starter-kv
   # Update wrangler.jsonc with the generated IDs
   ```

4. **Configure authentication secrets and email provider** ‚Äì Generate a random `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, create a Resend API key, and register the default "from" identity used by transactional email.

   ```bash
   wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
   wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
   ```

   Update `DEFAULT_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` and `DEFAULT_EMAIL_FROM_NAME` in `wrangler.jsonc` to match your verified sender. Run `npm run auth:generate` whenever you tweak the auth schema so the Drizzle tables stay aligned with Better Auth.

5. **Generate and apply database migrations** ‚Äì Use Drizzle Kit to keep D1 in sync.

   ```bash
   npx wrangler d1 migrations apply cf-next-starter-d1 --remote
   ```

6. **Develop locally with Cloudflare bindings** ‚Äì Install dependencies and run the dev worker shim.

   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run cf:dev
   ```

   Whenever bindings or secrets change, run `npm run cf-typegen` to refresh `cloudflare-env.d.ts` for accurate IntelliSense.

   Configure Better Auth by setting the `BETTER_AUTH_TRUSTED_ORIGINS` variable in `wrangler.jsonc` (or the Cloudflare dashboard) to a comma-separated list of allowed domains. The Worker falls back to `http://localhost:8787` and `*.workers.dev` when the variable is omitted, which keeps local development frictionless while still letting you tighten origins per environment.

## Automated Quality Gates

GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) guard every push and pull request:

- `Test and lint` workflow installs Node.js 20, caches dependencies, and runs `npm ci` for reproducible builds.
- Playwright browsers are provisioned so UI checks stay ready for action when you add end-to-end specs.
- ESLint and the CI-friendly `npm run test:ci` target execute Vitest alongside Playwright, uploading coverage, Vitest JUnit, and Playwright reports as artifacts.
- Failures feed directly into the GitHub Checks UI via `dorny/test-reporter`, helping reviewers triage regressions fast.

## Local Guardrails & Commit Workflow

- **Lefthook pre-commit and commit-msg hooks** run `lint-staged` and `commitlint` automatically so formatting and lint rules stay enforced before code lands in the repository.
- **Prettier + ESLint autofix** integrations keep JavaScript, TypeScript, Markdown, and stylesheets consistently formatted across the codebase.
- **Commitizen with cz-git adapter** (`npm run commit`) guides contributors through conventional commit messages that satisfy the commit linting rules and produce clear history.

## Feature Highlights

- üöÄ **Cloudflare-native deployment flow** ‚Äì `npm run preview` and `npm run deploy` orchestrate the OpenNext build, worker upload, and migrations end-to-end.
- üóÑÔ∏è **First-class data integrations** ‚Äì Sample routes illustrate reading and writing with D1, R2, and KV, surfacing live status directly in the app shell.
- üß∞ **Productivity tooling included** ‚Äì Storybook, Vitest, ESLint, and Playwright ship preconfigured so teams can focus on product velocity.
- üõ°Ô∏è **Type-safe platform bindings** ‚Äì `cloudflare-env.d.ts` enumerates every Worker binding, keeping runtime configuration transparent and type checked.
- üì¶ **Modern full-stack architecture** ‚Äì App Router layouts, server actions, and API routes come scaffolded for edge-friendly experiences across regions.
- üîê **Better Auth flows** ‚Äì Route handlers, D1-backed session storage, and verification emails rendered with React Email ship ready to customize.
- üîÅ **CI/CD friendly** ‚Äì Wrangler-compatible commands, artifact uploads, and typed environment contracts keep your GitHub ‚Üí Cloudflare workflow smooth and auditable.
